    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I'm a creative and technically advanced developer with years of experience delivering
      innovative digital marketing solutions, websites and web applications, who also happens to 
      have a strong arts and design background. 
      
      My career in web development began in Los Angeles working for the entertainment industry 
      as a Rich Media Designer/Developer. I started by working for industry giants such as Disney, Stan Lee, 
      and Sony, then consumer marketing agencies like TBWA/Chiat Day and Razorfish. In my spare time I taught
      computer graphics courses at the Art Institute and various non-profits. In mid-2000, I fulfilled a dream to move to New York, 
      landing a job at a startup called Daylife creating visualizations for a 
      news aggregation product. Eventually, I went back to 
      entertainment marketing full-time as a lead developer at Mammoth Advertising and there realized 
      my curiousity for coding exceeded my love of design. This passion for coding brought me to taking 
      more complex programming roles eventually leading to an enterprise-level development role for Ogilvy & Mather at IBM. 
      
      This combination of strong visual sensibilities and curiousity in coding
